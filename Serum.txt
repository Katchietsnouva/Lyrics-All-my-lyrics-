My lady bird 
Always dreamt of champagnes this bad 

How it feels your picture hanging gainst golden pillar
reality of a clip from a movie thriller
razzi over  here for the news to deliver
Watch our bodies flowing like a river
affording a foreing flight to have my dinner
smashed a record so i cry front a mirror
returning their words new version of a filter
returning  to my photo gainst golden pillar

Yes yes we go leap another time Yes yes we go leap
Yes yes we made it another time Yes yes made it



babe As a reminder i sent you a letter we go leap higher 
now the champagne glasses    wider
