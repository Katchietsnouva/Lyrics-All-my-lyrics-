listen close to the words I have for you 
Your form tempts my touch all day
And when am done touching you
I bet you wont go back to just any body
Your eyes fade into mine
A symphony in your body
Lets go inside honey 
Ecstacy body
Dance of passion
In your veins
These feelings not just to anybody
am the only one who knows how to control you honey
Body twine passion spark
